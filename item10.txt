Item 10: Obey the general contract when overriding equals
equals method is inherited from Object class. equals method from object class established equality between two objects
only when two references of the object are equal. 
for example:  
Object object1 = new Object();
Object object2 = new Object();
object1.equals(object2); // returns false
object1 = object2
object1.equals(object2); // returns true


There are casese when we want that behavior, but there are instances when we don't want, particularly value objects 
such as Integer or String or custom class such as Student.
