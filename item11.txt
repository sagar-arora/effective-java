Item 11: Always override hashcode when overriding equals method

a) when the hashcode method is inoved an object repeatedly it should return the same value, given the equals method is not 
changed between the executions.
b) If two objects are equal according to equals method then callnig hashcode on each of the objects should return the same 
integer value.
c) 

The key provision that is violated when you fail to override hashCode is
the second one: equal objects must have equal hash codes. Two distinct
instances may be logically equal according to a class’s equals method, but to
Object’s hashCode method, they’re just two objects with nothing much in
common. Therefore, Object’s hashCode method returns two seemingly random
numbers instead of two equal numbers as required by the contract.
