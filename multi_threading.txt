Conditions that can lead to deadlock:
a. Race Conditions : 

Suppose we have a poem and multiple poets are colloaborating to write a poem together.
class Poem {
  String poem;
  
  Poem(String poem) {
    this.poem = poem;
  }
  
  String getPoem() {
    return poem;
  }
  
  String setPoem(String poem) { 
    poem = poem;
  }
}

class Poet extends Runnable {
  private Poem poem;
  
  public Poet(Poem poem) {
    this.poem = poem;
  }
  
  void appendPoem(String poem) {
    String currentPoem = poem.getPoem();
    String newPoem = currentPoem + poem;
    poem.setPoem(new Poem);
  }
  
  String prettyPrintPoem() {
    return poem.getPoem();
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Poem myPoem = new Poem("Roses are red, skies are blue");
    Poet poet1 = new Poet(myPoem);
    Poet poet2 = new Poet(myPoem);
    poet1.appendPoem("blah blah blah");
    poet2.appendPoem("Howdy");
  }
}
